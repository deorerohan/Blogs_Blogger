# Videos for programmer

As I was not going to get time to demonstrate new concept I have created to senior management, I thought there are other ways to demo without asking for time. Hence I thought of creating video using things I have learnt so far.
Due to lockdown and working from home situation I was looking at how to stream videos. While doing that I reached to OBS software and Twitch.tv.  

In my case there were 3-4 slides and each slide had 4-5 sentences regarding a topic. Then there was demo of concept application created and a conclusion for demo. For very long time I was trying to get complete 5-10 mins video in single go but there would always happen something wrong which will destroy everything. After trying same thing again and again I got frustrated. While trying to creating a single 5 min video for 3-4 hours I had AH-HA moment. Each scene in movie or video is a small function. A scene is used as single block which should be perfect and to create final video you just have to put all functions in correct sequence. After I got the idea about it, I recorded everything in single go. If I made mistake I would start same sentence from start but never stopped video. I made lot of mistakes, but when I was done I was sure that I have whatever I wanted to say there in video in perfect way. It was just part of post processing video. Later I just decided which minutes are to be cut from complete video. In just 1 hr I had my video ready.  
I know 1 hr for 5 min video is too much but it was first time I had to learn each small thing on my own. I am sure next time when I want to create similar video I can do it in just 15-20 mins.

## OBS software

I love open source softwares.  
I have used OBS software for video recording and OpenShot software for video editing. I have used them for creating presentations in office.
You can download software from [official website][https://obsproject.com/].
There is lot of information on official [blogs][https://obsproject.com/blog]

OBS software is created for streamers but it contains very good option of recording to file. You just have to configure it as per your requirements.  
For current demo I was sure that I was not going to use any shortcut keys so I set very simple shortcut keys for starting and stopping of recording (Ctrl + 0). While I was showing presentation I wanted to connect to my audience so I added small size video of me from webcam in one side. But when I was showing application I needed complete screen so stopped my video. To accomplish that there is scene option in OBS, you can define multiple scene and each scene can have set of sources which can be video from webcam, or scene capture or audio input from any device. For above scenarios I created 2 scenes with and without my video and put shortcut keys like Ctrl + 1 and Ctrl + 2. So it was very easy to switch between scenes.  
You have to careful about creating setup and shortcut keys. If you are going to play games then Ctrl + 1/2 are wrong options are you might be using it in games. For that you can use function key. If you are going to record video regarding programming then using function keys is wrong idea as you may click those keys accidentally while doing development work. You can use some complex combination or may not use any shortcut keys.
